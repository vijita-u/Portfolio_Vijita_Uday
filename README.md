- **Contact Form**: Allows visitors to get in touch with me directly through a convenient contact form.

## Challenges faced and my process to create the website

Originally, I constructed my website using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I soon recognized the potential benefits of transitioning to React. Its dynamic routing capabilities and the desire to further my familiarity with the framework prompted the switch.

Initially, GSAP was my choice for animations, but its lack of seamless integration with React and the complexity of resulting code led me to search for a better solution. That's when I stumbled upon Framer Motion, an exceptional React animation library. Eager to embrace this new tool, I quickly immersed myself in learning its fundamentals and successfully implemented it in my portfolio.

This experience was my first dive into the world of Framer Motion, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
